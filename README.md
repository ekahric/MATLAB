Image Processing in MATLAB

A simple project created in order to test the Mathematical approach of the Image compression and transformation. This project was used on a simple picture. 

The whole process of image transformation and compression will be described by defining main theorems, using mathematical applications of Linear Algebra that have been covered in the class Advanced Linear Algebra 

All the applications and libraries of the MATLAB have been used independently and based on the gained knowledge throughout the class.
